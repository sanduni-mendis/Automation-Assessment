Challenges/Issues faced, and the workarounds applied. 
01. As I was new to the tech stack it was kind of challenge and overcame it by reffering to freely available tutorials and having discussions with QE collegues. 

02. When Initially started the project was getting a "SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module". This was sorted by removing deafualt pages which got added when creating the project.
Also to ensure it is not related to compiler issue which commonly comes with ES6, added Bable as well. 

03. When imported json files got an error saying type is not supported. It was sorted by adding "assert { type: "json" };" at the end of the import file path.
ex: import dataTC02 from '../testdata/dt_stay/dt_TC_02.json' assert { type: "json" };

04. It was challenging to figure out the logic to support clause "Should be further day from the currently system date and different between to dates should be 2 days". Found the sloution by googling to use Moment to get current date. 

05. Was struggling due to the TypeError: "elem[prop] is not a function". First thought it was related to xpaths, but then noticed it was due to spelling mistake in "click". When checked throughly noticed that i was omitted in click.
